## Overview

This project was my very first attempt at making something responsive. It was pretty fun putting the knowledge I've learned so far Into something responsive besides death by tutorial

### The Challenge

I was given the chance to build a simple recipe page for a Simple Omelette along with the nutritional information

### Links

- Live Site URL: (https://dova98.github.io/Simple-Omelet-Recipe/)

## My process

Google was my best friend throughout this whole process. It had been a constant back and forth between coding and searching on how to do things. I hadn't thought of a process before tackling this project but I had a general idea as to how I wanted my code to look

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Structuring my HTML elements is what I'm working on as a new developer. I wasn't aware that certain elemets had to be in order in order for certain things to work. I'm also still working on memorizing the most common elements and what they do so to help with all of this I have cheat sheets from Stanford University

### Continued development

Doing this from the beginning was honestly Intimidating due to all of the code to remember and memorize but I still powered through it all to the best of my ability. I would like to work on my projects to hone my skills and my confidence as a developer
